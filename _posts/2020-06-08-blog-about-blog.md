## Motivation

Okay, So from the beginning itself web-development looks really very cool to me. Maybe because it have some geeky touch or maybe the cool terms like databases, servers always used to attract me. Infact i was very much interested in almost everything related to computers. So, right from the first semester itself, i applied my hands on pretty much whatever and wherever i could!! I thought during the summers itself to develop my personal site for me to write about me and some blogs about the things i would explore in the near future. But you see it is a tiresome work, and i am a bit lazy (I mean very lazy :p). So writing so much of code wasn't my cup of tea. But i came to know about the static site generator `Jekyll`, I thought of creating one using it.

## Lets get to the point

Okay, so lets not bore you guys with the all emotional stuff :p. So i used `Jekyll` Static site generator to create this sweet little website. But creating one completely from the raw would have been quite a work. So, I took the shorter way and the most easiest way. I went to [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) site and selected this one from the hundreds of the open source templates given there. Cloned the repo and modified it with my information and also tweaked around a bit with the stuffs out there and :tada: tada :tada: final product is in front of you!!<br>

This Particular theme is called `devlopr` theme. You can check out this theme [here](https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll/).

## Conclusion

Yes, Yes i know it ain't much. Not even a 200 words long post, but hey its honest work afterall..:p Atleast thought to put something out here than to leave it for the tommorrow which is never!!
And shut up it free after all..:p<br>
Yes, Last but not least.. Stay tuned for more such "interesting" posts..<br>
I also have little interests in hindi poetry!! So do check out my further posts which would include some hindi poems. Who knows i may be useful to you in "some" way..
